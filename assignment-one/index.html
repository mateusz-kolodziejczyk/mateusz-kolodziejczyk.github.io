    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        Im Mateusz Kolodziejczyk and I'm a first year student
        in the Applied Computing course at WIT. It has been pretty enjoyable so far
        and in the process I've learned a few new skills already, like html and css as shown
        by this site.
    </p>
    <p>
        I've been living in Ireland since around 2006 and I've always been
        a little bit shy or timid ever since then so I've tended to enjoy the more
        solitary hobbies like gaming or programming or following a sport on my own which is what this site is about.

    <h2>What This Website Is</h2>
    <p>
        This is a <strong>student website</strong> for a first semester Web Dev project, basically a personal website
        that showcases some of my biggest interests with some information about them and about me as a person. Each page 
        will go more indepth as to why I like certain things and what they involve.
