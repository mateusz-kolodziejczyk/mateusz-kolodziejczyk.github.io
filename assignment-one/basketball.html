    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
        I've only started following basketball relatively recently, meaning the NBA in particular 
        which is the biggest basketball league in the world based in the US. I started watching it around 2015, when I 
        was still in secondary school. As the league is based in America, the games usually start pretty late, usually after midnight.
        This meant I usually can only watch them during the weekends when I don't have college/school the next day. However, I can still 
        follow the general news of it on social media even if I can't watch the actual games very often.

    <h2>My Favorite Team</h2>
    <p>
        My favorite team is the Boston Celtics in the NBA, they're one of the oldest
        teams, with the most won NBA championships but haven't won one since 2008
        I chose it as my favorite team mostly cause it shares my favorite color.
        in the logo and is also Irish themed which is where I grew up.
        They tend to be popular around here for a reason with Irish NBA fans.

    <h2>Memorable Games</h2>
    <p>
        My most memorable game involving the Celtics was a regular season(non playoff) game 
        versus the Golden State Warriors who won the NBA championship the year prior to that game.
        The Warriors team hadn't lost at home that entire season up till that point, but my team 
        managed to beat them in an exciting game. In terms of any basketball game, it must be
        the finals series that year between the Warriors and the Cleveland Cavaliers where Lebron James
        carried his hometown team to their firs NBA championship in history.
