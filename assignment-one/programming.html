    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
        I've only really started seriously programming a year ago, starting with
        the Python language while learning it from a book. However I've really wanted
        to learn how to program for much longer than that. I've tried to learn how to do
        it ever since I was around 12 years old, ironically also starting with Python
        but it never went anywhere really. I later tried to learn other languages but
        I never got the basics down so it only really took off a year ago when I started to
        approach it seriously, learning all the basics and theory properly.

    <h2>Why I enjoy it</h2>
    <p>
        I enjoy the mental challenge aspect of it, I've also tended to like maths and programming is
        fairly similar so it's not a surprise that I like it due to that. But it's also that every problem
        has a different solution in programming, and every problem has multiple solutions just like maths.
        This allows me to get somewhat creative in how I approach any programming problem which is also something I
        enjoy greatly.

    <h2>What I know</h2>
    <p>
        I've learned a variety of programming languages since Python, but the most important one was C# which I learned
        to be able to
        code games in the Unity Engine. The very different syntax forced me to think differently about how I approached
        things and as a result
        made my programming better in general. I've also dabbled in a bit of haskell, a functional programming language
        and I'm currently learning rust
        which is a relatively new systems programming language.

    <h2>What I've done</h2>
    <p>
        Over the last year I've done a few medium sized project, including making a functional chess game in unity
        which was probably the biggest one.
        This was also very early on in my programming life, so it wasn't the best, but it was functional. It also
        taught me many important concepts through
        actually making stuff work, which I appreciate a whole lot as that's the method of learning that works the best
        for me.
        I've also implemented a linked list and a binary search tree, which are both very common data structures in
        programming.
        Doing this taught me a lot about the inner workings of both of those.
