    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>I've been playing computer games since I can remember, one of my earliest memories involves one. In Poland we
        had a PC at home, no console.
        This was the norm in Poland as console games were much more expensive and harder to get than pc games.
        As a result I was on the computer from an early age, mostly using it for playing video games.
        I've played many of them over the years and my passion for them has never stopped.
    </p>
    <h2>Current Games</h2>
    <p>
        I mostly play World of Warcraft nowadays as I find it a nice way to spend my free time
        and it doesn't really require a huge time commitment for me at the moment. However if
        I had more free time I would also be playing Overwatch, which is another game by the same
        company who made WoW(World of Warcraft).
    </p>
    <h2>Favorite Games of all Time</h2>
    <p>
        One of my favorite games so far has been Persona 5, a jRPG(Japanese Role-Playing Game)
        released for the PS4. It's very similar to Pokemon in its combat system, but it also incorporates
        visual novel elements which would be similar to an anime. It also deals with much more
        mature themes than Pokemon's and is not aimed at children.
