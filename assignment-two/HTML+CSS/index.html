            <h2>What this site is</h2>
            <p>
                We are a charity shop based in New Ross, giving back to the community and thriving off of community
                support and donations. We aren't associated with any charity group, and are fully independent as a
                result.

            <h2>Who we are</h2>
            <p>
                We've been here for more than ten years, giving back to the community from direct donations and money
                from sales.
                We've grown a lot since we started, and are now known as one of the biggest charity shops in Wexford.

            <h2>What we do</h2>
            <p>
                We raise money from donations and sales of products donated to give back to people in the local
                community. 90% of money raised is donated to local causes,
                including new buildings and charity initiatives for poor and homeless people. The rest is all used to
                buy products and keep the shop afloat.
