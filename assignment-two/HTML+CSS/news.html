            <h2>New sponsorship with local soccer club</h2>
            <p>
                We are proud to announce a new sponsorship with a local soccer cup, which will involve
                a small patch on their jersey for the next season. We wish to get the word out about
                our organisation as we depend on your support to thrive as we are a charity organisation.
            </p>

            <h2>New aisle</h2>
            <p>
                Last week we were able to build a new aisle in our shop, all thanks to your support. This will help the overflow
                of donated items over the last few weeks, where they had to be stored in a local warehouse due to your unbounded
                generosity.

            <h2>Online Donations now Accepted</h2>
            <p>
                The online donation facility has been launched today, no longer will you have to come in person in order
                to donate to us. We would like for everyone reading this to consider giving even one Euro to us, as we
                depend on donations such as these to survive.

                This is the first news article written on this redesigned website, our last website not having been updated
