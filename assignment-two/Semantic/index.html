                <p>
                    We are a charity shop based in New Ross, giving back to the community and thriving off of community
                    support and donations. We aren't associated with any charity group, and are fully independent as a
                    result.

                <h2 class="ui header">
                    Who we are
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've been here for more than ten years, giving back to the community from direct donations and
                    money
                    from sales.
                    We've grown a lot since we started, and are now known as one of the biggest charity shops in
                    Wexford.

                    What we do
                </h2>
                <p>

                    We raise money from donations and sales of products donated to give back to people in the local
                    community. 90% of money raised is donated to local causes,
                    including new buildings and charity initiatives for poor and homeless people. The rest is all used
                    to
                    buy products and keep the shop afloat.
                </p>
